    <h1>Mathematics</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns. The word comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthema), meaning "science, knowledge, or learning", and is sometimes shortened to maths (in British Commonwealth countries) or math (in North America).
    </p>
    <h2>Mathematics includes the study of:</h2>
    
        <p><b>Numbers:</b> including how things can be counted.</p>

        <p><b>Structure:</b>  including how things are organized, but also how they can be or could have been. This subfield is usually called algebra.</p>
        <p><b>Place:</b> where things are, and spacial arrangement, including arrangements of spaces themselves. This subfield is usually called geometry.</p>
        <p><b>Change:</b> how things become different. This subfield is usually called analysis.</p>
        <p>Mathematics solves problems by using logic. One of the main tools of logic used by mathematicians is deduction. Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true (called a proof) is just as important as the fact that it is true, and this reason is often found using deduction. Using deduction is what makes mathematics thinking different from other kinds of scientific thinking, which might rely on experiments or on interviews.</p>
